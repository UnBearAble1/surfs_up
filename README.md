# Surfs Up!

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the suitability of a location to set up a combined surf store and ice cream shop. Based on previous experience of a business partner, the analysis reviews the weather of the desired location to ensure favorable conditions and inspire investor confidence in the proposal. Two time ranges 6 months apart have been selected with a review of the statistics of the temperatures of the area

## Results

The review of the temperatures of the two time periods in question show the following results:
- The mean temperature for both time ranges is very similar, with June having an average temperature of 74.94 degrees and December having an average of 71.04 degrees. Average Temperature does not seem to disqualify either timespan
- The max temperature for June is 85.00 degrees and for December is 83.00 degrees. Once again these similar temperatures do not show that either timespan would be disqualifying for the store to operate
- The minimum temperature for June is 64.00 degrees and for December is 56.00 degrees. This is a significant measurement and when temperatures are in this range, it could negatively impact operation of the business as consumers may not want to be in the ocean or purchase ice cream

## Summary

While the selected analysis shows that the temperatures of the locations, additional queries should look at the precipitation doing both months and determine if the shop can have sufficient business based on the precipitation levels.

As noted above, a study as to what the impact of temperature has on ice cream sales and the willingness of customers to get into the ocean. It is doubtful that the current dataset has this information, but would be useful for any business proposals

Another change that could be made is better defining the times that the measurements were taken. While the dates are clear for when temperature readings were taken, it can be assumed that the shop will only operate during hours with sufficient light and not during the middle of the evening when weather conditions can be different. It would be worthwhile to work with the source data to see if the time of date can be filtered to focus only on the planned hours of operation of the store.

Additionally, the review collected data from all of the weather stations across hawaii. It would be wise to separate out the weather stations and determine the climate conditions based on the areas they measure to see if one location would have more suitable conditions for business.
